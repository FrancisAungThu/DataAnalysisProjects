## Executive Summary
Despite high marketing expenditures, CookieMedia is currently facing a triple threat to its growth: declining customer engagement, stagnant conversion rates, and a lack of alignment between marketing content and consumer feedback. Significant investments in digital campaigns are failing to deliver expected returns, indicating an urgent need for data-driven strategy optimization.

## Dataset Summary
The dataset for the Cookie Media project consists of five interconnected tables (customers, geography, engagement data, customer reviews, customer journey) representing the end-to-end customer journey, from initial marketing engagement to post-purchase feedback. This relational structure allows for a 360-degree analysis of conversion friction and product performance.

## Busiess Problem & Objectives
The analysis was structured around three key business goals:

Increase conversation rates -- Identify factors influencing conversion rates and provide recommendations to improve them.

Enhance customer engagement -- Determine which types of content drives the highest engagement

Improve customer ratings -- Understand common themes in customer reviews and provide actionable insights.
